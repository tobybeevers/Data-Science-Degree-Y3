# Data Science Degree Year 3

This is a repo of the work and notes from the third year of my Data Science Degree at Bangor University, the repo is split into the module with a separte README file for each module.

### [ICE-3122-0 Information Visualisation](https://github.com/tobybeevers/Data-Science-Degree-Y3/blob/main/ICE-3122-0%20Information%20Visualisation)
**What is Information Visualisation?**

At its heart, information visualisation is about clarity and critical thinking. It’s the practice of turning data into visual forms that reveal meaning, insight, and patterns. We’re surrounded by data in business, science, social media, journalism, and research. But data alone isn’t enough, we must thing clearly and carefully to understand the data, map it to effective visualisations in a way that makes sense to the user. Visualisation helps us process information faster, make better decisions, and tell more compelling stories.

**Why it matters:**

Our brains are wired to understand visuals more quickly than text or numbers. A good visualisation can change the way we see the world. For example, think of COVID-19 timeline of cases, election maps, or Hans Rosling’s animated TED talks. Done well, visuals clarify and persuade. Done badly, they confuse or mislead.
